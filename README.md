# ISS_Overhead_Notifier
An app sending you an email if you can observe the ISS in the sky (only at night time as too hard to spot during day time)

You need to set your position using the constants in main.py
The times are UTC

You also need to set the variables for smtp_server, email and password in the __init__() method.
